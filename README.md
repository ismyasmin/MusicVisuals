# How it works

I have chosen a song that inspires me and reflects my style and interests. The Mario Kart Luigi Circuit. It has a clear structure, rhythm, and mood as the visual elements react well to the audio in real-time. The video will show this. It conveys a sense of mood, tempo, and narrative. I have used colour, shape, motion, and composition to create a visually compelling and dynamic representation of the song.   

 

The classes of the visuals import from the "**c22485282**" package into their own Java programs to reuse the functionality demonstrated in these classes to render a visual effect. The package contains classes and code examples demonstrating specific concepts and functionalities..

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
